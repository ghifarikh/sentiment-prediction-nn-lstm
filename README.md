# Sentiment Analysis Prediction Using Neural Network and LSTM

This repository contains an implementation showcasing deep learning modeling and prediction capabilities using Swagger UI.

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for modeling and making predictions on a specific task. It includes:

- **Deep Learning Model Development**: The repository includes code and resources related to the development, training, and evaluation of a deep learning model.
- **Swagger UI Integration**: Demonstrates how to expose the trained deep learning model as an API endpoint using Swagger UI.
- **Prediction Service**: Allows users to interact with the trained model via API calls to make predictions on new data.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before running the code:

- Python (along with necessary libraries specified in `requirements.txt`)
- LSTM and Neural Network framework (TensorFlow, sckit-learn)
- Swagger UI
